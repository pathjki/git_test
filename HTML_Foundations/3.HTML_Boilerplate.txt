Creating an HTML File
Always name the HTML file that contains the homoepage of our website as:
    index.HTML
Web servers will by dafulat look for an index.html page

The DOCTYPE
    Start HTML Page with doctype declaration
    Doctype = tells the browser what version of HTML it should use
    Doctype for HTML5 = <!DOCTYPE html>

HTML Element
    After doctype declaration, provide an <html> element A.K.A "root element"
    Root element of the document means that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.

Lang attribute
    lang specifies the language of the text in that element
    primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage, allows assistive techs to adapt according to the language.

Head Element <head>
    <head> element = where we put important meta-information ABOUT webpage
    <head> should NOT use any elements that display content on the page

    The Charset Meta Element <meta charset="utf-8">
        always have the meta tag for the charset encoding in in head element
        setting the encoding is important, it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols from diff. languages correctly.
    Title Element <title>My First Webpage</title> 
        Another element to always include in the head of an HTML doc.
        <title> is used to give a human-readable title displayed on the page's browser tab
        no <title>, the webpage title would default to file name ie. index.html

Body Element <body>
    where all content diplayed to user will go (text, images, lists, links, etc...)
