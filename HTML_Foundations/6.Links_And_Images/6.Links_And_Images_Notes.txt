Introduction
  Links allow us to link to other HTML pages on the web.

Anchor Elements <a></a>
  Use Anchor Elements<a> to create a link in HTML

  HTML Attributes
    clickin an <a> link doesn't do anything until we give it a destination to go to using
    the HTML attribute
      HTML attributes give additonal information to an HTML element and always goes in the opening tag
      An attribute is made up of 2 parts: A name and a value.
      <a href=""> adds a href(Hyperlink Reference) attribute to the opening tag.
  You can use anchor tags to link any other kind of resources on the internet
  (videos, .pdf,images,etc...)

Absolute and Relative Links
  Absolute Links
    Links to pages on other websites on the internet.
    Made up of following parts:
      protocol://domain/path
    Absolute links will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.
  Relative Links
    Links to other pages within our own website.
    does not include the domain name since it links to a page on the same site
    it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link
    Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.

./
  prepending "./" before yourl inks will prevent most issues related to pathing issues.
  by adding "./", you are specifying to your code taht it shoul start looking for the file/dir relative to the CURRENT dir.

Images <img>
  <img> element is empty (no closing tag)
  <img> embeds an image into the page using a "src" attribute.
  src works like href attribute for anchor tags.
  it can embed an image using both Absolute and Relative paths.
  Absolute path for an image example
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile 310x310.png>
  Relative path for img
    <img src="images/dog.jpg">

Alt (alternative text) Attributes
  Alt attribute is used to describe an image
  Used in place of the image if it can't load
  Also used with screen readers to describe the image for the visually impaired
  ie.
  <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile 310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">

Parent Directories
  us "../" in relative filepath to go to the parent directory.
  
Image Formats
  jpg (photos)
    Designed for handling of large color palettes without increasing file size excessively
    Good for photos and images with lots of gradients
    Don't allow for transparent pixels
  
  GIF (animations)
    simple animations, but limited color palette
    Transparent pixels are binary (on or off) meaning no semi-opaque pixels

  png (diagrams and icons)
    Good for things not a photo or animated
    Larger than equivalent JPG file
    Deal with opacity just fine
    Good fit for icons, diagrams, logos, etc...
  
  SVG (use them if filesize is not a concern and images needs to be scaled)
    Not pixel-based image, but Vector-based graphic, meaning can be scaled to any dimension without loss of quality
    Potential issue: for consistent display across browsers, any text fields need to be converted to outlines using image editor
    Having a lot of text in the image can impact file size and thus PNG might be better option. 

Dimensions <img src='example.png' width='#' height='#'>
  sets explicit dimensions for images
  better to set image dimensions with CSS
